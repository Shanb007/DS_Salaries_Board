Backend SDE II (Data Science),₹437K - ₹997K (Glassdoor Est.),"About ShareChat

ShareChat is India’s largest social media platform that provides a comfortable digital
space for the next generation of Internet users who want to use the Internet in their native
language. It is a platform that helps people share their thoughts, emotions, opinions and discover
friends without any language barrier. Founded in 2015, ShareChat offers an easy content
consumption and sharing platform in 15 Indian languages. Being an online medium for India’s
newest internet users, our platform sees a massive amount of variety in terms of content shared
– text, photographs, video content and a wide range of discourses that range from weekend
forwards to political conversations to celebrity updates to local festivals. In a nutshell, ShareChat
is at the forefront of the social media revolution and we want to redefine the way billions
of people are consuming content on social media.
AI @ ShareChat

India’s active internet user population has crossed half a billion in 2019. If you look closely at the
first 100 million Internet users and the rest of the users who came online in the last few years, you
will notice stark differences in their needs and wants from the Internet. While the first-generation
Internet users in India weren’t too different from Internet users in the rest of the world, the next
wave of users are truly unique in a number of ways. A huge chunk of audience is regional
language first audience and therefore wants to consume content and services in their native
language. Their taste in content also happens to be vastly different – we observe a long tail of
content genres emerging that didn’t exist previously. Despite the internet growing so swiftly, many
Indian Internet users are not comfortable with searching on the internet or finding whom to follow
in order to satisfy their information needs. A radically simplified paradigm for content delivery is
needed for this audience – one that automatically learns the user’s taste and pushes the right
content at the right time to them based on their interest. ShareChat harnesses AI in its quest
towards this mission.
Feed Intelligence

The core product value of ShareChat revolves around its algorithmically generated content feeds.
Our Feed Intelligence team is in charge of ensuring all feeds in the ShareChat app remain highly
engaging for our users at all times, optimizing multiple objectives of relevance, freshness, diversity
and so on. The team is also in-charge of ensuring relevance of key features across the app
including notifications, related content recommendations and so on.
ShareChat is seeking ML Engineers to join our Feed Intelligence team. As an ML Engineer on
the Feed Intelligence team, you will design and build backend ML systems to solve a variety of
relevance problems that operate at massive scale. The work will entail developing scalable data
pipelines that process billions of events to compute features for our ML models, developing
services that serve predictions from ML models at extremely high throughput and low latencies
and so on.
Responsibilities

Develop highly scalable algorithms based on state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques

Apply expert coding skills to develop scalable product features in partnership with other engineers on app and infrastructure teams

Office: Mumbai, India | Remote-work for the time being

About Us
Most of the world’s digital information was created in the last few years with the vast majority of that information being unstructured in the form of text, tweets, videos, images, blogs, etc. The rate of growth of digital information vastly exceeds our biological processing abilities. The consequence for investors is that it’s becoming harder to make sense of the factors that drive financial markets. Acting upon partial understanding of vast quantities of information (i.e., heuristics) infuses investment decisions with cognitive biases. In order to beat markets and make money, humans need to augment their reasoning capacity, consider the relevance of more information, and make bias-free decisions.
At Accrete.AI, our vision is to help investors generate alpha, or excess returns, by training machines to think in the language of the markets. We leverage deep learning and Machine Augmented Collective Intelligence (MACI) to train machines to reason and learn so they can help human investors make better investment decisions.",4.7,"Accrete.AI

We empower our 160 million strong monthly active user community to share their opinions, record their lives and make new friends - all within the comfort of their language of choice. Our short video platform Moj, is today India's preferred short video destination with tens of millions of users from across the world. The platform has been designed for artists and creators to create innovative short video content and display their creativity to millions, globally. At ShareChat we are spearheading India's internet revolution. By providing a meaningful social experience, we are determining how the next billion users will interact on the internet.

AI @ ShareChat

If you look closely at the first 100 million Internet users from India and the rest of the users who came online in the last few years, you will notice stark differences in their needs and wants from the Internet. While the first generation Internet users in India weren’t too different from Internet users in the rest of the world, the next wave of users are truly unique in a number of ways. A huge chunk of the audience is a regional language first audience and therefore wants to consume content and services in their native language. Their taste in content also happens to be vastly different – we observe a long tail of content genres emerging that didn’t exist previously. Despite the internet growing so swiftly, many Indian Internet users are not comfortable with searching on the internet or finding whom to follow in order to satisfy their information needs. A radically simplified paradigm for content delivery is needed for this audience – one that automatically learns the user’s taste and pushes the right content at the right time to them based on their interest. ShareChat harnesses AI in its quest towards this mission possible.

We’re HIRING !!!

The AI team at ShareChat is growing. We are hiring talented individuals with expertise in the areas of Recommender Systems, Reinforcement Learning, Bayesian Optimisation, Deep Learning on Graphs, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speech Processing and so on. Our team of world class scientists and engineers push the boundaries of state of the art in these areas and impact millions of people every single day. We have a strong focus on research and actively collaborate with academics on open-ended research problems.

C amera Intelligence

Within the AI umbrella our Camera Intelligence team builds unique capabilities in the ShareChat camera to help our users create engaging, original content on our platform. They focus on efficient implementations of capabilities in Computer Vision (e.g., semantic segmentation, super resolution, augmented reality and more...) and Audio Processing so that they can run on mid to low end smartphones. Our mission is to enable every creator, across the long tail of content genres, to unleash the superpowers of AI and be able to create professional grade content.


Develop highly scalable algorithms based on state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Apply state of the art in the relevant research domains to make significant contributions to the feature roadmap of the ShareChat app in the aforementioned areas.

Apply expert coding skills to develop scalable product features in partnership with other engineers on app and infrastructure teams

Apply best practices in big data processing to build feature stores, data pipelines and model inference services that can deal with massive scale.

Adapt deep learning algorithms to on-device applications, tune network architectures to efficiently run on low to medium end smartphones. Exploit modern parallel environments (e.g. distributed clusters, GPUs).

Provide technical guidance to junior members of the team and drive their productivity and expertise growth.
